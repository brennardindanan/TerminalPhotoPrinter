# About
This program's purpose is to print a photo as a black-and-white image represented by an array of characters '1' and '0' (printed as "*" and "." respectively) in 3 ways - as a raw photo, as a packed photo, and as an encoded photo. All ways the photo is printed will be the same, however their size in memory will be different, with the raw photo being the largest, and the encoded photo being the most compressed, respectively. The respective bytes for each photo will be printed alongside the photos themselves.

# List of Files
- brennard_a2.c: Contains source code needed to execute
- README.md: Contains this description

# Compiling and Executing
1. Navigate to the folder containing the source code in a terminal,
2. Use the command 'make' to create the file 'a2' which can be executed,
3. use the command './a2' while in the folder containing the executable to run the program

# Usage Instructions
1. After executing the file 'a2' from the steps above, observe the photos of the ghosts (printed with '*' and '.' respectively).
2. There should be 3 versions of the first ghost photo, and 3 versions of the second ghost photo. The versions will be "Raw photo", "Packed photo", and "Encoded photo", respectively, with each photo sizes respective bytes.
